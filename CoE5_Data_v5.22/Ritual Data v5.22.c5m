#                        COE5 RITUAL DATA IN MOD FORMAT
# 
# This file contains the ritual data for CoE5, extracted from the executable. 
# Although this file is not actually a mod, its contents adhere to CoE5's
# modding format in order to make it an optimal resource for modders.  That
# said, much of the information here can be useful to players, as well.
# 
# For modders, this file provides examples of how base game rituals can be
# built using modding commands (although some rituals in the base game do use
# some commands that are not available to modders) and templates that modders
# can use to create their own rituals.
# 
# For players, this file provides detailed information on how each ritual works
# and what it does.  In addition to being a time-saving reference, it also
# includes information that isn't visible anywhere in game, with examples
# including lists of possible results from summoning rituals, lists of source
# and destination units for promotion rituals, and the chances of successfully
# controlling certain summons.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
#                           INFORMATION FOR PLAYERS
# 
# Everything to the right of a "#" (such as what you're reading now) is a
# comment, which means the game ignores it; it's there as a note for human
# readers (i.e. you).  I've provided comments on the right-hand side of most
# lines to explain what all the modding commands on the left actually do, so if
# you're not a modder, you can pretty much ignore most things on the left and
# just read the comments.
# 
# The major exceptions are:
# 
# -Lines beginning with newritual or selectritual.  The part between the "" is
# the name of the ritual; the comment with the number on the far right is the
# ritual's index number, which you can ignore.
# 
# -Lines beginning with descr.  The part between "" is the description shown in
# game when you right-click on the ritual.
# 
# -Commands whose names and meanings are especially obvious generally either
# don't get comments, or don't repeat the command name at the start of the
# comments, for the sake of brevity.  Two examples: "level 1" doesn't get a
# comment because the comment would be "# Level: 1"; "cost 0 25" gets the
# comment "# 25 Gold" instead of "# Cost: 25 Gold".
# 
# -Lines beginning with addstring.  Usually, these are found on summoning
# rituals, and the part between the "" (called the string) represents one
# possible result (a monster or group of monsters) that can appear when the
# summoning occurs.  Sometimes, one of a few special parenthetical expressions
# at the beginning of the string will give it a different meaning, in which
# case I'll explain that in a comment following the string.
# 
# If a line begins with "# fx" followed by a number, that means it's either a
# command that isn't accessible to modders, or I haven't taught the app to
# translate it yet (or both).  I present these as comments because they don't
# have mod command names that the game would recognize (so to adhere to the
# modding format, I need to tell it to ignore them), but the part that's
# actually intended for humans to read is the second comment, to the right. 
# Two examples:
# 
# fx1034               7 # [notplanereq]: Primal; cannot be cast on this plane.
# 
# fx1044               1 # Unhandled trait 1044 with argument 1.
# 
# The first example is a command that isn't accessible to modders.  You can
# safely ignore everything to the left of the second "#".  The word in [] is my
# guess at what Illwinter might call this command if they did make it
# accessible to modders.  Everything after that is my explanation of what it
# does; in this case, it prevents the ritual from being cast on the Primal
# Plane.
# 
# The second example is a command the app doesn't know how to translate (you
# can recognize these by the words "Unhandled" or "Unknown").  Unless you want
# to guess at their meanings, you can ignore these, other than to remember that
# there's some detail about the ritual that isn't explained yet.
# 
#                   ----------------------------------------
# 
#                                  Addstrings
# 
# At its simplest, a summoning string might look like this:
# 
# addstring     "Frost Fiend"
# 
# which means that if that string is the one randomly selected by the ritual,
# it will summon one Frost Fiend.  Toward the more complex end of the spectrum,
# a summoning string might look like this:
# 
# addstring     "c*Ancestral Chief & 1d3+1*Ancestral Lancer"
# 
# The "c*" means that an Ancestral Chief will be summoned and given commander
# status.  The "1d3+1*" means the game will roll a 3-sided die and add 1 to
# determine the number of Ancestral Lancers.  The two monster types are in the
# same string, joined by an "&", which indicates that if that string is
# randomly chosen, it will summon both an Ancestral Chief commander and 1d3+1
# Ancestral Lancers.
# 
#                                  ----------
# 
# Some summoning strings start with a number in parentheses, such as:
# 
# addstring     "(167)Anakite"
# 
# addstring     "(-110)Se'ir"
# 
# In these cases, the number represents a terrain, or if negative, one of the
# game's predefined terrain groups.  (167) means terrain 167, which is
# Ziggurat; (-110) means terrain group -110, which is desert-like terrains. 
# When a string begins with a parenthetical number, it means that string will
# only be included in the pool of possible random results when cast on the
# specified terrain; otherwise, it will be impossible.  When these terrain
# limiters occur, I provide comments following the string to explain them.
# 
#                                  ----------
# 
# A few summoning strings begin with the parenthetical expression "(!)", which
# applies special rules intended for magical familiars.  If the (!) string is
# the one selected, one of the following things will happen, in descending
# order of priority:
# 
# 1. If one or more of the specified units is present, one of them will be
# promoted to the unit defined after it in the Monster Data (e.g. Frog Familiar
# -> Magic Frog Familiar).
# 
# 2. Otherwise, if one or more of a promoted version of the specified unit is
# present, one of them will be randomly selected to learn a new level 1 spell. 
# If it already has all of the level 1 spells it can learn, it won't actually
# get anything, and the casting will have wasted AP and resources for nothing.
# 
# 3. If none of the specified unit or its promoted version are present, one of
# the specified units will be summoned.
# 
#                                  ----------
# 
# Another type of ritual that uses strings is the promotion ritual.  Rather
# than summoning a randomly selected string, a promotion ritual will take all
# of its addstring lines, momentarily excluding any that begin with a special
# parenthetical expression, and split them into pairs in the order they're
# listed.  Each pair is a promotion path; the first string of each pair is the
# kind of unit that can be promoted, while the second string is the kind of
# unit it will become.  For example, on a promotion ritual:
# 
# addstring     "Dwarf"
# addstring     "Rime Dwarf"
# addstring     "Dwarf Warrior"
# addstring     "Rime Warrior"
# 
# means that the ritual can turn a Dwarf into a Rime Dwarf or a Dwarf Warrior
# into a Rime Warrior.
# 
#                                  ----------
# 
# transformtarg rituals are another way of using strings.  These work similarly
# to promotion rituals, except that there's no need to specify the kind of
# units that can be changed, so instead every string (again, excluding any that
# begin with a special parenthetical expression) is a possible result of the
# transformation.  When the ritual is cast, one of the strings will be randomly
# selected, and the target will be changed into whatever monster that string
# specifies.  For example:
# 
# addstring     "Soldier Mirror"
# addstring     "Animal Mirror"
# 
# means that the target will become either a Soldier Mirror or an Animal
# Mirror, with a 50% chance of each.
# 
# There's also a variation of transformtarg (when its argument is 2, instead of
# 1) where if the selected transformation would reduce the target's ritual
# caster level, it will become the monster defined after that in the Monster
# Data, instead.  For example, the Necromancy ritual Blood Rite, which targets
# only the caster and has transformtarg 2 and:
# 
# addstring     "Vampire"
# 
# is saying that if it's cast by a Necromancer, he will become a Vampire (since
# they both have Necromancy ritual power, level 2), but if it's cast by a Grand
# Necromancer (who has level 3), he will instead become a Vampire Count (which
# is also level 3), since that's the next monster after Vampire in the Monster
# Data.
# 
#                                  ----------
# 
# One last way that strings not beginning with a special parenthetical
# expression are used in the base game's Ritual Data is for levelupmon rituals.
# Seen only in various Warlock Pact rituals, levelupmon works a lot like the
# normal version of transformtarg, except the target will only be changed to
# the monster specified in the string if the target's ritual power level is
# below the value of levelupmon.  For example, the first version of the ritual
# Earth Pact, which targets only the caster and has levelupmon 2 and:
# 
# addstring     "Warlock of Earth"
# 
# is saying that it will only change the caster into a Warlock of Earth if he
# isn't already a Warlock of Earth (level 2) or Great Warlock of Earth (level
# 3).
# 
#                                  ----------
# 
# Several times above, I've mentioned special parenthetical expressions with
# which a string can begin, which will change its meaning.  These are (+), (-),
# and (&).
# 
# (-) is the one seen most often, and it means that the string will only be
# used to tell one of the commands beginning with "nomon" one of the kinds of
# monsters that should prevent the ritual from being cast.
# 
# For example, the Senator ritual Coronation is a promotion ritual with
# nomonworldreq and the following addstrings:
# 
# addstring     "(-)Emperor"
# addstring     "(-)Dark Emperor"
# addstring     "(-)God Emperor"
# addstring     "(-)God Emperor of the Underworld"
# addstring     "(-55)Senator"
# addstring     "Dark Emperor"
# addstring     "Senator"
# addstring     "Emperor"
# 
# The first four begin with (-), so each of them is telling nomonworldreq one
# kind of unit to look for: if an Emperor, Dark Emperor, God Emperor, and / or
# God Emperor of the Underworld exists anywhere in the world, the ritual cannot
# be cast.
# 
# Note that the fifth string does not start with (-); it starts with (-55), so
# it's a terrain limiter, as explained earlier.  This means it's actually one
# of the pairs of strings used by promotion, so those last four strings are
# saying: if cast on a damned capital (terrain -55), change a Senator into a
# Dark Emperor; otherwise, change a Senator into an Emperor.
# 
# (+) is only seen in the base game in Ritual of Scourge Mastery, but it can
# actually be used with any ritual that uses a command beginning with "nomon". 
# If the monster in a string beginning with (+) satisfies the condition of the
# "nomon" command, it disables all (-) strings after it.
# 
# For our example, Ritual of Scourge Mastery has level 1, nomonmasteryreq, and
# the following addstrings:
# 
# addstring     "(+)Scourge King"
# addstring     "(-)Scourge Lord"
# 
# This means that normally, it cannot be cast if you have a Scourge Lord, but
# there are two exceptions: first, as is normal for nomonmasteryreq, if the
# caster is higher level than the minimum needed to cast the ritual (so, level
# 2+; i.e. a Scourge Lord or Scourge King), he can cast it (but minimum level
# casters, meaning Scourge Heralds, still can't); second, because of the (+)
# string, if you have a Scourge King, then having a Scourge Lord no longer
# prevents anyone from casting it (so even Scourge Heralds can now cast it).
# 
# Finally, (&) strings are used only to tell minmonreq, monworldreq, or
# monplayerreq commands which kinds of monsters can satisfy their requirements.
# (&) is to those commands what (-) is to "nomon" commands.
# 
#                   ----------------------------------------
# 
#                          Summoning String Selection
# 
# Barring the presence of sum0chance (and the other sum[x]chance commands) or
# sum0snow, all summoning strings are equally likely to be chosen as the result
# of the summons.  The game appears to simply count the number of strings (or
# the number remaining after these commands) and roll a die of that size to
# pick which to use.
# 
# When sum0chance is present (or sum0snow, if the ritual is cast on a snowy
# square), it receives a separate d100 roll to see whether to choose the first
# string, before moving on to sum1chance or the remaining strings.  In this
# way, sum0chance (or sum0snow) is exactly as likely to succeed as its argument
# (the percentage chance shown for it) says.
# 
# sum1chance, on the other hand, is only used when sum0chance has already been
# used in the same ritual.  sum1chance, too, receives a separate d100 roll to
# see whether it triggers, but it occurs after the check for sum0chance, and
# only if that check fails.  As a result, sum1chance is actually less likely to
# succeed than its argument suggests.  In keeping with basic probability, the
# actual percentage chance for sum1chance to succeed would be modeled by this
# formula:
# 
# (1 - (sum0chance / 100)) * sum1chance
# 
# The other sum[x]chance commands work the same way, with each higher number
# becoming even less likely to succeed than its argument indicates, because all
# earlier checks must fail first.
# 
# Let's break down the most complicated example in the ritual data.  The ritual
# Summon Lesser Beings has sum0chance 5, sum1chance 5, and sum2chance 10 with
# the following strings:
# 
# addstring     "Bakeneko"
# addstring     "c*Tengu Weapon Master"
# addstring     "c*Mujina"
# addstring     "2d3*Kappa"
# addstring     "Karasu Tengu"
# addstring     "1d3*Konoha Tengu"
# 
# The actual chance of the first string, Bakeneko, is just the 5% specified by
# sum0chance 5.
# 
# To get the actual percentage chance of the second string, Tengu Weapon
# Master, we need to convert the percentage chance of getting the first string
# (5%) to a probability (meaning, divide by 100), then subtract it from 1 to
# find the probability of failing to get the first string.  Then we multiply
# that by the stated chance of sum1chance to get the actual chance.  Like so:
# 
# (1 - (sum0chance / 100)) * sum1chance
# (1 - (5 / 100)) * 5 = 4.75%
# 
# To get the actual percentage chance of the third string, we follow a similar
# process, only this time, we need to multiply sum2chance by the probability of
# failing to get both the first and second strings:
# 
# (1 - ((5 + 4.75) / 100)) * 10 = 9.025%
# 
# That leaves us with the last three strings, and since we're out of the
# sum[x]chance commands, all remaining strings split the remaining probability
# equally between them.  Thus, the percentage chance of each of the last three
# strings is:
# 
# (100% - (5% + 4.75% + 9.025%)) / 3 =  27.075%
# 
# You can use similar means to calculate the actual chance of any string in any
# summoning ritual.
# 
# One final note on the subject of summoning chances: the ritual Banquet for
# the Dead has sum0chance 50, but only one string, which may leave you
# wondering what to expect when casting it.  In my testing, it appears that
# sum0chance 50 has no effect on this ritual; the one string is summoned every
# time it is cast.  I assume there is a safeguard requiring that a ritual have
# at least two strings before sum0chance can take effect, and that this is the
# reason sum0chance is harmless in Banquet for the Dead.  As a side note, the
# inclusion of sum0chance 50 in Banquet for the Dead looks to me like a copy-
# paste error from Grand Blood Feast.
# 
# Similarly, the ritual Summon Storm Giant has sum0chance 66, but only one
# string.  Again, it always summons the one string, and again, it appears to be
# a copy-paste error, this time from Summon Champion of Air.
# 
#                   ----------------------------------------
# 
#                           Unusual Summoning Rituals
# 
# Most summoning rituals actually just create new monsters, rather than moving
# and repossessing existing monsters.  However, there are a number of rituals
# that include strings with monsters that have the "unique" trait.  Most of
# these monsters are one-of-a-kind and created at the start of the game.  When
# one of them is selected by a summoning ritual, the game checks if they're
# available and if so, teleports them to the caster.  If that monster isn't
# available, the ritual will simply fail with the message "No one answered the
# summoning", but the costs of the ritual will already have been paid.  This
# can make fishing for uniques even more expensive as the pool of available
# uniques dwindles.
# 
#                                  ----------
# 
# Rather than using strings, the two versions each of Minor Animal Summoning
# and Major Animal Summoning use the specpow command to somehow determine the
# types and numbers of monsters to summon.  Certain terrains (including at
# least Ancient Forests, Forests, Jungles, Deserts, and Spider Thickets) affect
# what can be summoned, but the exact mechanics of these rituals remain
# mysterious.
# 
#                                  ----------
# 
# The ritual Call Primal Being uses another unique summoning mechanic instead
# of strings.  When cast, it searches the Primal Plane for all eligible
# monsters, then randomly chooses one of them to teleport to the caster's
# location and changes ownership of it to the casting player.
# 
# In my tests, the complement of eligible monsters present at the start of the
# game was largely identical from game to game, varying only in the number of
# Ents and the types of Beholders:
# 
# 8x Beholder
# 1x Horned God
# 1x Hammer God
# 1x God of the Seasons
# 1x God of War
# 1x Goddess of the Sacred Spring
# 1x God of the Sea
# 1x Thrice Horned Boar
# 1x Rams-Headed Serpent
# 3x Hooded Spirit (one of each of the three types)
# 7-15x Ent
# 
# Each of the Beholders has an equal chance (47.5%) to be either of the two
# types, with a 5% chance to be an Elder Beholder instead.
# 
# The Beholders and Ents are mortal; once killed, they're gone for good, and in
# my tests, no new ones ever spawned.  The other Primal Beings are immortal
# unless killed on the Primal Plane; if killed anywhere else, they'll respawn
# on the Primal Plane, revert to being controlled by the independents, and be
# eligible to summon again.
# 
# If no eligible monsters remain on the Primal Plane, casting Call Primal Being
# fails with the message "No one answered the summoning", but still wastes AP
# and Herbs.
# 
#                   ----------------------------------------
# 
#                     Control Chance For Summoning Rituals
# 
# The base chance to control each type of monster summoned by a ritual is
# determined as follows:
# 
# 1. If the ritual does not contain the defctrl command, control cannot fail.
# 
# 2. Otherwise, if the monster has a defined ctrlchance, use that.
# 
# 3. Otherwise, use the ritual's defctrl.
# 
# For rituals with the varcost command, the base control chance is further
# modified by the Sacrifice Level (SL) used to cast the ritual.  For SL 0 to
# 100, the following formula is how final control chance is determined:
# 
#  final_control_chance = base_control_chance * (resources_spent / cost)
# 
# For example, with a base control chance of 60% and a cost of 40 sacrifices,
# you could spend 30 sacrifices (0.75 times normal) for a 45% final control
# chance (also 0.75 times normal).
# 
# Newly in CoE5, increasing Sacrifice Level above 100 gives diminishing
# benefits to control chance.  The exact formula is unknown, but the game
# manual provides two points: when spending 1.5 times base cost, final control
# chance will be 1.33 times base control chance; and when spending 2 times base
# cost, final control chance will be 1.5 times base control chance.  Thus, the
# further above 100 Sacrifice Level rises, the less cost-effective it becomes.
# 
# For rituals with varcost 100 (which in the base game means the Demonology and
# Bakemono summoning rituals), Sacrifice Level can be set anywhere from 0 to
# 200.  If you have a powerful enough army to fight uncontrolled summons with
# negligible casualties, SL 100 is the most cost-effective choice.  Otherwise,
# it's often a good idea to maximize control chance, especially if final
# control chance can reach 100%.  Since SL 200 will give 1.5 times base control
# chance, the lowest base control chance that can reach 100% final control
# chance on a varcost 100 ritual is 67%.
# 
# On the other hand, while Sacrifice Level 0 and its guarantee that the
# summoned monsters will attack you may sound like a bad idea, it can be very
# useful in some cases.  If you have charm or enslavement abilities, you may be
# able to take control of some of the summoned monsters without having paid
# anything for them.  Further, some summoned monsters (most notably those of
# the Summon Demon Lieutenant ritual) can spawn with items.  If you can charm,
# enslave, or kill them with negligible casualties, you can farm items at no
# cost by using SL 0.
# 
# For rituals with varcost 50 (which in the base game means the Witchery
# summoning rituals), Sacrifice Level can be set anywhere from 50 to 150. 
# Since SL 150 will give 1.33 times base control chance, the lowest base
# control chance that can reach 100% final control chance on a varcost 50
# ritual is 75 or 76%, depending on how the game rounds.
# 
# As with SL 0 on varcost 100 rituals, SL 50 on varcost 50 rituals can be
# useful.  If you can reliably charm or enslave the summoned monsters, you may
# be able to get them at half price by using SL 50.
# 
# As a final note, when a string contains multiple types of monsters, my tests
# suggest that the game rolls only once for control, using the base control
# chance of only the first monster in the string (its ctrlchance if it has one
# and the value isn't 0; otherwise the ritual's defctrl).  If the control roll
# succeeds, all monsters in the string will be controlled; if it fails, all
# will be uncontrolled.  The only example of this in the base game is the
# ritual Deep Rising, which includes the following:
# 
# addstring     "c*Basalt Prince & 2d6*War Shambler & 4d6*Deep One Warrior"
# 
# Because Deep Rising has defctrl 66, the base control chance for any monster
# without its own defined ctrlchance will be 66%.  In the above string, this is
# true of Basalt Prince and Deep One Warrior.  However, War Shambler has
# ctrlchance 80, meaning its base control chance is 80%.  Because the game only
# rolls for control once for the entire string and only the first monster's
# control chance matters, the Basalt Prince's use of defctrl 66 gives the
# entire above string a base control chance of 66%, effectively making the War
# Shamblers harder to control than they would otherwise be.
# 
# Longtime readers may recall that it used to be the highest control chance
# that mattered, not the first.  This behavior appears to have changed sometime
# between when I first tested it in CoE4 v4.18 and when I tested it again in
# CoE5 v5.22.
# 
#                   ----------------------------------------
# 
# At the end of this file are a number of ritual descriptions unaccompanied by
# any other data.  A few of these are simply unused descriptions, but most are
# used by the Ceremonies of the Voice of El.  The Ceremonies have no data there
# beyond their names and descriptions because their data is not found with that
# of the other rituals.  Where it is and how it's encoded remains unknown.

#                           INFORMATION FOR MODDERS
# 
# The CoE5 modding manual is a very useful source of information, and I'd
# consider it required reading for anyone who wants to mod CoE5, as well as a
# recommended read for anyone who is at all interested in how the game works. 
# That said, in working on the ritual data, I have encountered a few
# discrepancies and omissions from the modding manual.
# 
# Throughout this file, I have written comments explaining each command, with
# the goal of saving the reader from as much cross-referencing with the modding
# manual as possible.  Many of these comments are copied directly from the
# modding manual, and others are adapted slightly to suit my needs.  However,
# there are a few commands whose descriptions there I have found to be
# incomplete or inaccurate.  In any case of conflict between my comments and
# the modding manual, I have written what I believe to be correct.  Of
# particular note are these commands:
# 
# defctrl (with an argument of 997)
# apcost (with a negative argument)
# unfollowtarg
# rebateterr20
# 
# defctrl 997 is never mentioned in the modding manual; it is a special value
# with three effects: 1. control of summonings cannot fail, 2. log text is
# "raised" instead of "summoned", and 3. sound played is digrydoo.smp
# (didgeridoo) instead of orchhit.smp (summoning).
# 
# When the apcost command is used, the ritual's actual AP cost will be apcost's
# argument plus one.  The modding manual doesn't explicitly mention that apcost
# can take a negative argument, which it can.  Thus, apcost can be used to make
# a ritual cost no AP or even refund AP.  E.g. apcost -1 will give actual AP
# cost 0, and apcost -2 will refund 1 AP.
# 
# unfollowtarg does not, as the modding manual states, make anyone stop
# following the target.  Rather, it makes the target stop following anyone.
# 
# Contrary to the modding manual, the game's own interface, and the number
# included in the name of the command, rebateterr20 actually reduces ritual
# cost by 25%, not 20%.  This is probably a bug.
# 
#                   ----------------------------------------

#                             Ritual Modding Maxima
# 
# CoE5 has reserved space for a total of 3000 rituals, including those from the
# base game and all simultaneously activated mods.  This gives us a rough
# ballpark of how many rituals can be added by mods (3000 minus the number
# reserved for the base game), but not an exact number.  Illwinter reserve more
# slots for base game rituals than are currently in use, so that they can add
# new rituals in future updates without breaking every saved game that uses
# mods with new rituals, but to my knowledge, they haven't stated exactly how
# many ritual slots they've reserved for the base game.  Probably there's room
# for mods to add at least 2000 rituals; I very much doubt there's room for
# more than 2400.
# 
# Each ritual's name can be up to 48 bytes long.  How many characters that is
# depends on how many bytes it takes to express each character in UTF-8
# encoding.  Usually, it's one or two bytes per character, so that means 24 to
# 48 characters.
# 
# Each ritual has reserved space for 4 instances of the cost command (you can
# use less, but not more).
# 
# Each ritual has reserved space for 1 (and only 1) each of the following
# commands: ritpow, level, and terr.  Each ritual also has reserved space for
# each of the 11 (at the time I write this) commands within the Ritual Learning
# Difficulty sub-section in the modding manual.
# 
# Each ritual has room for 48 addstring commands.  Each of those strings (the
# part between "") can be up to 256 bytes long.  Again, how many characters
# that is depends on how many bytes it takes to express each character in UTF-8
# encoding.
# 
# Each ritual has room for 14 fx commands.  From the Summoning Commands header
# to the end of the Ritual Modding section of the modding manual, expect every
# command there that has not already been mentioned here to use up one of the
# ritual's fx command slots.

The quills will float and dance in the air and obey simple orders from anyone that wants their help accounting, documenting trade contracts and writing autobiographies.  The ritual is quite time consuming and can only be cast where people work and live.  The animated tools will increase the trade gained from the settlement by +1, up to double the original value.  The enchantment animating the quills is local and they can't leave their place of creation."

For centuries no troll has dared to disturb the sleep of the one known as Gramps, well aware that should the Ageless Troll be rudely awakened he would smack every present troll in the face. If a troll loses its face it will probably die regardless of its regenerative powers. However, if enough goblins were present, the Ageless Troll might be awakened without trolls being smacked around. The trick is to invite a tribe of loudmouthed goblins to a great feast in the Troll King's Pit, giving them plates and spoons and telling them that the one who bangs the loudest will get the first serving of the troll stew cooking in that great cauldron over there. The goblins, firmly believing that the troll stew will turn them into trolls, will do what goblins do best. If properly prepared the instigator will have time to disappear before the clamor and clang of the goblins awakens the Ageless Troll from his centennial slumber."

The life force is channeled to the Scourge Lord who will use it to empower his agents or summon beings of manifest destruction. Forests and settlements give more life force than plains. Mountains and hills give very little life force and deserts are devoid of life force. With time the surrounding terrains will wither and eventually turn into deserts. Oceans have less life force available, but cannot wither away. A settlement that is under the influence of an active Pillar of Power will produce ghouls that gather at the pillar, awaiting their master's call. The Pillar can drain up to 15 points of life force from the surrounding lands. If there is more life force available the excess will not be drained until some lands have withered away."

Kobold Hatcheries will automatically produce kobolds of the color corresponding to the gems found in the mine.  Mines with high gem incomes produce more kobolds.  It will also enable special recruitment of the corresponding gem type.  Black Kobolds and Stone Drakes can be recruited in all hatcheries, regardless of gem type.  The Hatchery is protected by simple rock walls for defence."

The ritual will create different variants of Bhuta-possessed Longdead and Soulless, depending on what corpses are available when it is cast. If the possessed corpses are of the monkey-people they can be moved to a citadel to get monkey-quality armor upgrades."
