#                        COE5 TERRAIN DATA IN MOD FORMAT
# 
# This file contains the terrain data for CoE5, extracted from the executable. 
# Although this file is not actually a mod, its contents adhere to CoE5's
# modding format in order to make it an optimal resource for modders.
# 
# This file provides examples of how base game terrains can be built using
# modding commands (although some terrains in the base game do use some
# commands that are not available to modders) and templates that modders can
# use to create their own terrains.
# 
# Everything to the right of a "#" (such as what you're reading now) is a
# comment, which means the game ignores it; it's there as a note for human
# readers (i.e. you).  I've provided comments on the right-hand side of most
# lines to explain what all the modding commands on the left actually do, so if
# you're not a modder, you can pretty much ignore most things on the left and
# just read the comments.
# 
# If a line begins with "# Unknown", "# 0x" or "# Command" followed by a
# number, that means it's either a command that isn't accessible to modders, or
# I haven't taught the app to translate it yet (or both).  I present these as
# comments because they don't have mod command names that the game would
# recognize (so to adhere to the modding format, I need to tell it to ignore
# them), but the part that's actually intended for humans to read is the second
# comment, to the right.
