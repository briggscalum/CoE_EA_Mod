#                        COE5 WEAPON DATA IN MOD FORMAT
# 
# This file contains the weapon data for CoE5, extracted from the executable. 
# Although this file is not actually a mod, its contents adhere to CoE5's
# modding format in order to make it an optimal resource for modders.
# 
# This file provides examples of how base game weapons can be built using
# modding commands (although some weapons in the base game do use some commands
# that are not available to modders) and templates that modders can use to
# create their own weapons.
# 
# Everything to the right of a "#" (such as what you're reading now) is a
# comment, which means the game ignores it; it's there as a note for human
# readers (i.e. you).  I've provided comments on the right-hand side of most
# lines to explain what all the modding commands on the left actually do, so if
# you're not a modder, you can pretty much ignore most things on the left and
# just read the comments.
# 
# The major exceptions are:
# 
# -Lines beginning with newweapon.  The part between the "" is the name of the
# weapon; the comment with the number on the far right is the weapon's index
# number, which you can ignore.
# 
# -Commands whose names and meanings are especially obvious generally either
# don't get comments, or don't repeat the command name at the start of the
# comments, for the sake of brevity.  Two examples: "range 1" doesn't get a
# comment because the comment would be "# Range: 1"; "dmgtype 1" gets the
# comment "# Slash" instead of "# Damage Type: Slash".
# 
# If a line begins with "# 0x" or "# wep" followed by a number, that means it's
# either a command or argument that isn't accessible to modders, or I haven't
# taught the app to translate it yet (or both).  I present these as comments
# because they don't have mod command names that the game would recognize (so
# to adhere to the modding format, I need to tell it to ignore them), but the
# part that's actually intended for humans to read is the second comment, to
# the right.  If that comment includes a word in [], it's my guess at what
# Illwinter might call this command if they did make it accessible to modders. 
# Everything after that is my explanation of what it does.
# 
#                   ----------------------------------------
# 
# Regarding aoe (area of effect), it may not be immediately obvious what the
# difference is between "single target" and "burst 1".  They only behave
# differently when a unit occupies the same square as a terrain object (such as
# a bush or wall).  In such a case, "single target" will hit only the weapon's
# chosen target (usually the unit, unless the weapon is one of the few that
# targets terrain objects directly), whereas "burst 1" will hit both the unit
# and the terrain object.

#                           INFORMATION FOR MODDERS
# 
#                            Weapon Modding Maxima
# 
# CoE5 has reserved space for a total of 5000 weapons, including those from the
# base game and all simultaneously activated mods.  This gives us a rough
# ballpark of how many weapons can be added by mods (5000 minus the number
# reserved for the base game), but not an exact number.  Illwinter reserve more
# slots for base game weapons than are currently in use, so that they can add
# new weapons in future updates without breaking every saved game that uses
# mods with new weapons, but to my knowledge, they haven't stated exactly how
# many weapon slots they've reserved for the base game.  Probably there's room
# for mods to add at least 3500 weapons; I very much doubt there's room for
# more than 4000.
# 
# Each weapon's name can be up to 48 bytes long.  How many characters that is
# depends on how many bytes it takes to express each character in UTF-8
# encoding.  Usually, it's one or two bytes per character, so that means 24 to
# 48 characters.
