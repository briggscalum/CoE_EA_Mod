#                       COE5 MAGIC ITEM DATA IN MOD FORMAT
# 
# This file contains the magic item data for CoE5, extracted from the
# executable.  Although this file is not actually a mod, its contents adhere to
# CoE5's modding format in order to make it an optimal resource for modders. 
# That said, much of the information here can be useful to players, as well.
# 
# For modders, this file provides examples of how base game magic item can be
# built using modding commands (although some magic item in the base game do
# use some commands that are not available to modders) and templates that
# modders can use to create their own magic item.
# 
# For players, this file provides detailed information on each magic item's
# stats and traits.  Among other uses, this provides a solution to one of the
# game's lingering issues--that you can't see any information (other than the
# name) about an item that's offered for purchase until after you've already
# bought it.  Hopefully, this information will someday be made available in
# game before purchasing the item, but unless and until that happens, you can
# at least look the item up here to see whether it's worth purchasing before
# you commit.

#                           INFORMATION FOR PLAYERS
# 
# Everything to the right of a "#" (such as what you're reading now) is a
# comment, which means the game ignores it; it's there as a note for human
# readers (i.e. you).  I've provided comments on the right-hand side of most
# lines to explain what all the modding commands on the left actually do, so if
# you're not a modder, you can pretty much ignore most things on the left and
# just read the comments.
# 
# The major exceptions are:
# 
# -Lines beginning with newitem.  The part between the "" is the name of the
# magic item; the comment with the number on the far right is the magic item's
# index number, which you can ignore.
# 
# -Lines beginning with descr.  The part between "" is the description shown in
# game when you right-click on the magic item.
# 
# -Lines beginning with itemwep.  The part between the "" is the name of the
# weapon associated with the magic item.  You can use that name and the index
# number (nbr) in the comment to look it up in the Weapon Data.
# 
# -Lines beginning with combatsum.  The part between the "" is the string that
# determines what will be summoned.  Usually, it's just the name of a monster,
# such as "Bear", which means 1 Bear will be summoned.  A more complex example
# such as "2d3+2*Myrmeke" means the game will roll two 3-sided dice and add 2
# to determine the number of Myrmeke units to summon.  If the string has
# multiple types of monsters separated by "&", then it will summon all of them
# at once.
# 
# -Lines beginning with combatspell.  The part between the "" is the name of
# the spell that will be cast.
# 
# -Commands whose names and meanings are especially obvious generally either
# don't get comments, or don't repeat the command name at the start of the
# comments, for the sake of brevity.
# 
# If a line begins with "# fx", "# res", "# aff", "# ben", "# move", or "# unk"
# followed by a number, that means it's either a command that isn't accessible
# to modders, or I haven't taught the app to translate it yet (or both).  I
# present these as comments because they don't have mod command names that the
# game would recognize (so to adhere to the modding format, I need to tell it
# to ignore them), but the part that's actually intended for humans to read is
# the second comment, to the right.
# 
# If a comment includes "# From ben" followed by a number, you can ignore that
# part.  It's a note to myself about how that instance of the trait was
# encoded, which should have no relevance to players.

#                           INFORMATION FOR MODDERS
# 
#                          Magic Item Modding Maxima
# 
# CoE5 has reserved space for a total of 1000 magic items, including those from
# the base game and all simultaneously activated mods.  This gives us a rough
# ballpark of how many magic items can be added by mods (1000 minus the number
# reserved for the base game), but not an exact number.  Illwinter reserve more
# slots for base game magic items than are currently in use, so that they can
# add new magic items in future updates without breaking every saved game that
# uses mods with new magic items, but to my knowledge, they haven't stated
# exactly how many magic item slots they've reserved for the base game. 
# Probably there's room for mods to add at least 500 magic items; I very much
# doubt there's room for more than 700.
# 
# Each magic item has reserved space for 1 (and only 1) each of the following
# commands:
# newitem (or name, if you're modifying an existing item), descr, spr, rarity,
# type, itemwep, combatsum, and combatspell.
# 
# Each magic item's name can be up to 48 bytes long.  How many characters that
# is depends on how many bytes it takes to express each character in UTF-8
# encoding.  Usually, it's one or two bytes per character, so that means 24 to
# 48 characters.
# 
# Each magic item's combatsum string can be up to 64 bytes long.  Again, how
# many characters that is depends on how many bytes it takes to express each
# character in UTF-8 encoding.  Note that this is much less than the 256 bytes
# of a ritual addstring, so just because a given summoning string fits in a
# ritual doesn't necessarily mean it will fit in a magic item.
# 
# Each magic item has room for 14 fx commands.  Unfortunately, the modding
# manual isn't organized in such a way as to make it easy to tell which
# commands will use up an fx slot and which won't.  Commands already mentioned
# here as having reserved space will not use up an fx slot.  Otherwise, if the
# command can take an argument other than 0 or 1, it will use up an fx slot. 
# However, even if the command takes no argument, or the argument can only be 0
# or 1, it might use up an fx slot or it might not, depending on how it was
# implemented.
